# 3-stage EVPN VXLAN NVD with EDA  
> **Pre-requisite requirements:** This repository assumes that the user already has EDA deployed (using the kind installation method) with the SIMULATE flag set to false, which allows onboarding of external nodes (containerlab or real hardware). 

The 3-stage EVPN VXLAN NVD digital twin deployment with EDA uses a two spine, six leaf topology deployed/instantiated using Containerlab and orchestrated by EDA. It covers the following server connectivity use cases:

- Layer 2 untagged server connectivity
- Layer 2 tagged server connectivity
- Layer 3 server connectivity with static routes on the leaf, injected into BGP EVPN
- All-active ES-based LAG multihoming with 802.3ad on server side
- Single-active ES-based multihoming with active/backup server NICs and LACP standby signaling
- Active/backup server NICs with no LAG 

## Deployment using Containerlab and EDA

EDA (with the kind installation) and the Containerlab topology are deployed on the same physical server, with each creating their own respective bridges. Once the lab is deployed using `sudo containerlab deploy -t 3-stage-with-eda.clab.yaml`, you must ensure that iptables rules are correctly in place for communication between these two bridges. Example shown below, where 172.19.0.0/16 is the EDA Kind bridge and 172.21.21.0/24 is the Containerlab bridge to which all nodes are connected.

> Minimum required containerlab version: 0.61.0

## Deploying EDA fabric constructs

Once you have confirmed that the EDA license is installed and valid (using `kubectl describe license -A`) and the fabric nodes are reachable via the bootstrap server pod `bsvr`, you can then use the script `deploy-3-stage-nvd.sh`. This is a prescriptive bash script built specifically for the Containerlab NVD topology found in this repository. It deploys all the necessary EDA components to bring the fabric to life (the script simply does a `kubectl apply` for the individual manifest files and ensures that they are successfully applied before proceeding to the next file).

A snippet of the script deployment is shown below:

```

### Destroying the fabric

For quick teardown, another bash script called `destroy-3-stage-nvd` is provided as well. Again, this is a prescriptive script, specific to what is deployed using the `deploy-3-stage-nvd` script.
