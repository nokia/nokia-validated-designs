## Nokia reference designs

The main distinction between the Nokia Validated Designs (NVDs) and Nokia Reference Designs is analogous to that of a supported product versus an open-source community version of the same product.

The validated designs (NVDs) are designs or end-to-end solutions officially supported, tested on hardware and recommended by Nokia. It will have a lifecycle management system, migration paths, official configuration recommendations, and solution support by Nokia support and services organizations.

Reference designs are meant to be design guides which demonstrate alternate design and product capabilities of the Nokia portfolio, but do not undergo solution-wide hardware testing and are not subjected to end-to-end lifecycle management and migration path testing like the NVDs.  With that disclaimer in place, the reference designs are also tested designs by deploying them as virtual fabrics using Containerlabs. These are ensured to be functional designs and have deployable GitHub repositories which can be downloaded and customized for further use, testing and exploration.
